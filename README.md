# Spectre "Runmaster"
## 007 Spectre Omega Speedmaster style watchface

* With date and battery indicator that move with the hands - always being on the opposite side for readability.
* The date/battery complications are configurable via the Garmin Connect App once the watch face has been installed via the store. Available options for either slot are date, battery %, heart rate, steps, and then ability to leave either one blank.
* So far tested physically with:
  * Fenix 6 Pro / Sapphire
  * Forerunner 935
  * Venu 2



## Direct install
If you want to directly use the watchface, please head to the [Connect IQ page](https://apps.garmin.com/en-US/apps/904f5de7-2dc6-456f-9f5d-fc81dd47c53e)
