# Spectre "Runmaster"
## 007 Spectre Omega Speedmaster style watchface

* With date and battery indicator that move with the hands - always being on the opposite side for readability.
* So far tested physically with:
  * Fenix 6 Pro / Sapphire

Pending Garmin review on connect IQ store, should be available shortly.


## Direct install
For the directly usable watchface, download the *.prg* file (Fenix 6 / older version) or *SpectreRunmaster.prg* (Venu 2 specific) and copy it to your watch/GARMIN/APPS/ directory.


# Source code
For the source, please refer to the .mc files. You need to set up an Eclipse environment with Garmin's SDK to edit/test/build the code.
