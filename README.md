## 007 Spectre Omega Speedmaster style watchface

* With date and battery indicator that move with the hands - always being on the opposite side for readability (or can be locked to 12/3/6/9 o'clock in the settings)
* The date/battery complications are configurable via the Garmin Connect App once the watch face has been installed via the store. Available options for either slot are date, battery %, heart rate, steps, and then ability to leave either one blank.
* So far tested physically with:
  * Fenix 6 Pro / Sapphire
  * Fenix 7S Sapphire Solar
  * Forerunner 935
  * Venu 2
