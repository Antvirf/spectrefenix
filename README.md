# Spectre Fenix / Spectre "Runmaster:
## Spectre-Speedmaster style watchface for Fenix 6 Sapphire
(Additionally called runmaster, since should work on other watches as well)

* With date and battery indicator that move with the hands - always being on the opposite side for readability.
* So far tested physically with:
  * Fenix 6 Pro / Sapphire



## Direct install
For the directly usable watch-face, download the *SpectreFenix-main.prg* and copy it to your watch/GARMIN/APPS/ directory.


# Source code
For the source, please refer to the .mc files. You need to set up an Eclipse environment with Garmin's SDK to edit/test/build the code.
